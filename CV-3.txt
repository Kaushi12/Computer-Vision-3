1) A stride 2 conv with the default padding (1) and ks (3) will reduce the activation map dimension by half. Formula: (n + 2*pad - ks)//stride + 1. As the activation map dimension reduces by half we double the number of filters. This results in no overall change in computation as the network gets deeper and deeper.

2)Increase in size of a convolutional kernel would necessarily increase the performance of a convolutional neural network. Kernel size is a hyperparameter and therefore by changing it we can increase or decrease performance. Suppose we have a deep neural network model which was trained on a vehicle detection problem.
